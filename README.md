<h1>React Native Demo Svg</h1>

This is a React Native demo app made to test `react-native-svg` in isolation
 to make sure that it doesn't crash the app when combined with a gradient.
 
 It uses the expo cli, which will have to be downloaded if not already
  installed:
  
  `npm install -g expo-cli`
 
 ## Running
 `cd` into the project root and `yarn ios` to start the metro bundler and ios
  simulator. Alternatively, download the Expo App to run on a device.
